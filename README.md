                                                      Telecom Churning Modeling

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive framework that enables a proactive retention strategy for a telecom company. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically predictive modeling, the aim is to identify customers who are likely to churn. This allows the company to implement preemptive measures, reducing customer attrition and fostering a more stable customer base.

Predictive Framework
The predictive framework achieved an 80% accuracy in identifying telecom customers who are likely to churn. The following tools and algorithms were employed in the analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration of the dataset to gain insights and understand patterns.
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for predicting churn based on historical customer data.
Decision Tree: A tree-based model to capture nonlinear relationships within the data.
Random Forest: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
Gradient Boosting: A boosting algorithm to enhance the performance of weak predictive models.
Stacking Classifier: A meta-algorithm combining multiple base models to achieve higher predictive accuracy.
Recommendations
The predictive model provides actionable insights for implementing a proactive retention strategy. Key recommendations include:

Offer Discounts on Yearly Contracts: Identify customers at risk of churning and provide incentives such as discounts on yearly contracts to encourage long-term commitment.

Convert Customers to DSL: Address challenges with fiber optic services by proactively converting customers to DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) to enhance service satisfaction.

Device Protection Plan with Online Services: Introduce a device protection plan coupled with enhanced online services to add value for customers and reduce the likelihood of churn.

Proactive vs Reactive Scenario
In a reactive scenario, measures are taken only after a customer has decided to leave, often in the form of promotions or financial incentives. However, the proactive approach employed in this project involves predicting potential churners before they make a decision to leave. By offering targeted facilities or services ahead of time, the company aims to prevent customer churn and foster long-term customer relationships. This proactive strategy aligns with the broader objective of enhancing customer retention through data-driven insights.
